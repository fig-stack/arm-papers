I've been invested in the ARM architecture for the last couple of days, so I decided to keep track of some good papers that i've read about it.

| Title | Authors | Year | Key Topics |
|-------|---------|------|------------|
| "InversOS: Efficient Control-Flow Protection for AArch64 Applications with Privilege Inversion" | Zhuojia Shen & John Criswell | 2023 | Control-flow Protection |
